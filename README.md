whmcs-registrars-coza
=====================

**whmcs-registrars-coza** is a domain registrar module connecting the CO.ZA
zone with WHMCS. It uses EPP for communicating with the Registry via the
php-epp2 library.

It is written in modern PHP and tries to fix some shortcommings of the existing
registrar modules.
